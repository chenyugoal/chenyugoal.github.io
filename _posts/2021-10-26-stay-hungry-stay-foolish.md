As you may have noticed,
my study and research track during undergraduate study was 
Translational Cell & Tissue Engineering.
It emphasizes knowledge about physiology, animal surgery, 
biomaterials, drug delivery and so on.
When entering JHU BME, however,
I grew interests in harnessing the power of computers and electronics, 
so I switched to the Imaging & Medical Devices Track.
I use Coursera and YouTube heavily to take prerequisite courses 
so that I can catch up with those graduate-level courses in this track.

**I will use this blog to record my progress.**
