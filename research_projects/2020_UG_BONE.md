title:  Bioactive Scaffolds for Bone Tissue Engineering
---

> Bone is well known for its self-healing abilities. However, for large-scale defects, 
> bone cannot heal itself completely. 
> In such case, external intervention is needed.
> By implanting a bioactive scaffold into the defect area,
> we provide a place for cells to adhere, proliferate and differentiate,
> thus accelerating the process of bone tissue regeneration.
