[BRAID: Brain Age Identification from Diffusion MRI]{:.heading.flip-title}

Traditional brain age estimation often relies on macro-structural features, such as the size and shape of brain regions. In this study, we take a novel approach by intentionally discarding such information through deformable registration, directing the model's attention to micro-structural features within diffusion MRI. These subtle, textural patterns are known to change earlier than macro-structural features in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's, offering the potential for earlier detection and intervention.

[FOV extension for brain diffusion MRI via deep generative models]{:.heading.flip-title}

Not all brain diffusion MRI scans capture the entire brain. For scans with an incomplete field of view (FOV), analyses of whole-brain tissue microstructure and connectivity can be severely limited. Instead of discarding such data, can we leverage deep generative models to extend the FOV and recover the missing information? Our approach aims to repair incomplete scans, enabling more comprehensive analyses and preserving valuable data.

[Characterizing patterns of DTI variance in aging brains]{:.heading.flip-title}

Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measurements of brain microstructure are known to be associated with age. But what about the uncertainty of these measurements? Does it increase or decrease with age? This study explores such relationships and emphasizes the importance of considering heteroscedasticity in analyses.

[Effects of Defacing Whole Head MRI on Neuroanalysis]{:.heading.flip-title}

Recent advances in magnetic resonance (MR) scanner quality and 
the rapidly improving nature of facial recognition software 
have necessitated the introduction of MR defacing algorithms to protect patient privacy. 
As a result, there are a number of MR defacing algorithms available to the neuroimaging community, 
with several appearing in just the last five years. 
These various approaches have qualities that have been explored 
with respect to skull stripping masks or identifiability of the patient 
in previous works. However, to our knowledge 
there has been no evaluation of the subsequent impact of these defacing algorithms 
on a neuroimaging pipeline. In this work, we use six MR defacing algorithms 
on 179 subjects from the OASIS-3 cohort and 21 subjects from the Kirby 21 dataset, 
then apply a neuroimaging pipeline to the resultant defaced images. 
We compare the consistency of the output from the pipeline using the defaced images 
with the output of the same pipeline without defacing the MR data.

## 2021
[Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation and Survival Prediction]{:.heading.flip-title}

This is the final project (II) of *Medical Image Analysis*. 
We implemented a 3D Multimodal U-Net with sparse annotation, 
and a Cascaded Anisotropic Convolutional Neural Networks for brain tumor segmentation respectively.
Based on the segmentation result, 
we extract Radiomics features and predict on the survival time of patient using regression tree ensembles.

[Neural Decoding for Patients with Upper Limb Paralysis]{:.heading.flip-title}

Inspired by the experiment of Elon Muskâ€™s Neuralink, 
where the monkey could play video games with its brain, 
we implemented two algorithms for neural decoding, 
the Long Short-term Memory Networks and the Kalman Filter, 
in our course project of *Neural Implants & Interfaces*.

## 2020 - 2021
[Progressive Learning: A Potential Algorithm for Lifelong Learning Machines]{:.heading.flip-title}

In biological learning, 
data are used to improve performance simultaneously on the current task, 
as well as previously encountered and as yet unencountered tasks. 
In contrast, classical machine learning starts from a blank slate, 
or tabula rasa, using data only for the single task at hand. 
While typical transfer learning algorithms can improve performance on future tasks, 
their performance on prior tasks degrades upon learning new tasks (called "catastrophic forgetting"). 
Many recent approaches have attempted to maintain performance given new tasks. 
But striving to avoid forgetting sets the goal unnecessarily low: 
the goal of ProgLearn is to improve performance on all tasks (including past and future) with any new data.

## Undergraduate research (before 2020)

[Bioactive Scaffolds for Bone Tissue Engineering]{:.heading.flip-title}

Bone is well known for its self-healing abilities. However, for large-scale defects, 
bone cannot heal itself completely. In such case, external intervention is needed. 
By implanting bioactive scaffolds into the defect area, 
we provide places for cells to adhere, proliferate and differentiate, 
thus accelerating the process of bone tissue regeneration. 
Below is the schematic illustration of bioactive gelatin cryogels 
with BMP-2 biomimetic peptide and VEGF for synergistically induced osteogenesis. 
The paper has been accepted by *Chinese Chemical Letters*.
