An easy-to-use [website](https://m250.shinyapps.io/bird_recognition/) for bird image classification. 
Upload a photo (any resolution will be fine) of bird, 
then it will tell you the top-5 most likely bird species it belongs to.

This is the final project (II) of *Medical Image Analysis*. 
We implemented a 3D Multimodal U-Net with sparse annotation, 
and a Cascaded Anisotropic Convolutional Neural Networks for brain tumor segmentation respectively.
Based on the segmentation result, 
we extract Radiomics features and predict on the survival time of patient using regression tree ensembles.

Inspired by the experiment of Elon Muskâ€™s Neuralink, 
where the monkey could play video games with its brain, 
we implemented two algorithms for neural decoding, 
the Long Short-term Memory Networks and the Kalman Filter, 
in our course project of *Neural Implants & Interfaces*.

[Progressive Learning: A Potential Algorithm for Lifelong Learning Machines]{:.heading.flip-title}

In biological learning, 
data are used to improve performance simultaneously on the current task, 
as well as previously encountered and as yet unencountered tasks. 
In contrast, classical machine learning starts from a blank slate, 
or tabula rasa, using data only for the single task at hand. 
While typical transfer learning algorithms can improve performance on future tasks, 
their performance on prior tasks degrades upon learning new tasks (called "catastrophic forgetting"). 
Many recent approaches have attempted to maintain performance given new tasks. 
But striving to avoid forgetting sets the goal unnecessarily low: 
the goal of ProgLearn is to improve performance on all tasks (including past and future) with any new data.
