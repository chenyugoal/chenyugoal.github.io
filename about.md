> A person who is addicted to the rewarding cycle of confronting a daunting challenge, persevering through the difficulty, and ultimately achieving a breakthrough.

I am a 4th year Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Vanderbilt University, advised by Dr. [Bennett Landman](https://my.vanderbilt.edu/masi/people/bennett-landman-ph-d/). I am passionate about applying and innovating machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems, especially in the medical imaging domain. Prior to Vanderbilt, I earned a master's degree in Biomedical Engineering from Johns Hopkins University, where I was advised by Dr. [Jerry Prince](https://iacl.ece.jhu.edu/index.php?title=Prince).


**I am actively looking for research- or engineering-focused internship (or full-time positions) in AI/ML/Tech/Biotech industries starting in 2026.**


## News
- *August 30, 2025*: I wrapped up a wonderful summer internship at [insitro](https://www.insitro.com/), where I designed a multimodal, self-supervised representation learning framework for novel gene discovery. I worked closely with my mentor [Kaiwen Xu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaiwen-algo/) and my manager [Nick Eriksson](https://www.nickeriksson.com/), who provided incredible support and guidance, and many colleagues on the Compute team who helped accelerate the development and validation of our method.
