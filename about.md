## Certificates
*As you may have noticed,
my study and research track during undergraduate study was 
Translational Cell & Tissue Engineering.
It emphasizes knowledge about Physiology, Animal Surgery, 
Biomaterials, Drug Delivery and so on.
When entering JHU BME, however,
I grew interests in harnessing the power of computers and electronics, 
so I switched to the Imaging & Medical Devices Track.
I use Coursera heavily to take prerequisite courses 
so that I can catch up with those graduate-level courses in this track.*
